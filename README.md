A simple Python chatroom with RSA keys authentication
=====================================================

About
-----

This is a simple chatserver that uses server-client RSA key based authentication.
I added dynamic keypair generation for server and clients (on startup each generates
4096b long key) and exchanges public keys when connected.
This way there is no need to create encrypted keys for clients and server.

To be sure that communication really is encrypted, you can use wireshark,
or git pull the repo and edit server.py part where messages are recieved and
print them.

This is my trial text!!

Installation:
-------------
    git clone https://github.com/lunemec/python-chat.git
    pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt

For server:
-----------
    python server.py listen_ip listen_port

For clients:
------------
    python client.py username server_ip server_port



Note:
-----
I found a simple chatserver recipe on the internet with some bugs. I fixed most of them,
added a encryption and message signing. If there are some bugs, you can report them to me,
but no promisses :)

If anyone would like to use it, you do it on your own risk.
Maybe in future I'll get back to it and make this software easier to use.
